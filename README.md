# Stewart-Platform
In this project, a 6 degree of freedom stewart platform robot was designed and developed for tumor immobilization. 
The stewart platform consists of a fixed base and a moving platform connected through six linear servo motors. 
The platform can move in six degrees of freedom, namely, translation in x, y, and z directions, and rotation about x, y, and z axes. The platform movement is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board and a set of sensors that provide the necessary feedback for closed-loop control. 
The main objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective and efficient stewart platform for tumor immobilization that can be used in radiotherapy treatments. The proposed design is based on the stewart platform architecture, which provides a stable and precise platform motion. The platform can immobilize the tumor and ensure that the radiation beam is focused on the tumor accurately.
Base of Stewart Platform:
The base of a Stewart Platform, also known as the lower platform, serves as the foundational structure on which the entire mechanism rests. It is a critical component of the platform, and its design plays a vital role in ensuring stability, support, and proper functioning of the system. In the context of a Stewart Platform with six servo motors, the base design is particularly important as it needs to accommodate these actuators and provide a solid platform for the upper platform to move upon.  Here is an explanation of the basic design aspects of the base for a Stewart Platform with six servo motors:  Shape and Structure: The base is typically designed to have a specific geometric shape, often circular or hexagonal, to evenly distribute forces and ensure uniform support for the upper platform. The base should be rigid and robust to handle the mechanical stresses and forces during operation.  Mounting Points: The base should have six mounting points, evenly distributed around its perimeter, to secure the servo motors. These mounting points serve as the attachment locations for the servo motors, which are then connected to the upper platform through the extensible legs.  Servo Motor Configuration: The six servo motors are placed at the mounting points on the base. The selection and positioning of these motors are crucial for achieving the desired range of motion and payload capacity of the Stewart Platform.  Electronics and Wiring: The base design should incorporate provisions for accommodating the electronics required to control the servo motors. This includes motor drivers, microcontrollers, and wiring channels to manage the electrical connections between the motors and the control system.  Material Selection: The choice of materials for the base is essential to ensure the required strength, rigidity, and weight-bearing capacity. Commonly used materials include metals like aluminum or steel, which provide a good balance of strength and weight.  Stability and Balance: The design should prioritize stability and balance to prevent any tilting or rocking motion during operation. Proper weight distribution and a low center of gravity are crucial factors to consider.  Clearance for Movement: The base design should allow sufficient clearance for the motion of the servo motors and the extensible legs without any obstruction.  Bearing and Rotation: Depending on the specific design, the base may incorporate bearings or other rotation mechanisms to allow the upper platform to move smoothly in all directions. 
 Overall, the basic design of the base for a Stewart Platform with six servo motors involves a combination of mechanical engineering principles, material science, and electronics to create a stable and functional foundation for the entire mechanism. Careful consideration of these design aspects ensures the platform's proper operation, accuracy, and reliability in various applications, such as robotics, flight simulators, or motion platforms for virtual reality experiences.
